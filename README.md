# Gold-Price-Prediction

🔍 Project Overview
In this project, I developed a Gold Price Prediction System using machine learning algorithms to predict the future prices of gold based on historical data. This project leverages data from a real-world gold price dataset to forecast prices and evaluate model performance, providing insights into the factors influencing gold price fluctuations.

📊 Key Steps & Methodology

Data Exploration:

Explored the dataset to understand the features and distribution of the target variable (GLD price).
Performed correlation analysis to identify important features that correlate with the target.
Data Preprocessing:

Dropped irrelevant columns (like the date) and prepared the data for modeling.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80% for training, 20% for testing).
Model Training:

Trained a Random Forest Regressor model, a powerful ensemble learning algorithm, to predict gold prices based on historical data.
Model Evaluation:

Used R-squared (R²) to evaluate the model's performance. A high R² value indicates a good fit for predicting the target variable.
Visualization:

Visualized the actual vs predicted gold prices to assess the model’s prediction accuracy.
Created a heatmap to visualize correlations between different features.
🧠 Learning Outcomes

Gained hands-on experience with data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
Improved my understanding of Random Forest Regressor and its application to regression tasks.
Enhanced my data visualization skills, making complex results more accessible.
🚀 Tech Stack:

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn (Random Forest Regressor, Metrics, Train/Test Split)
